Originally, I come from Cluj-Napoca, Romania, known as the Silicon Valley of Transylvania. </p><p> Every year I make time to improve as a developer focusing on the key skills of my role. My current skill-set includes JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, GraphQL, Git, Webpack, HTML5, CSS3 + preprocessor like SCSS using the BEM methodology, jQuery, PHP, GitHub, Bitbucket and agile workflows. </p><p> I have experience developing custom made themes for CMS's like WordPress and Drupal but between the two of these, I prefer working with WordPress which drove me to learn how to use WP-CLI. </p><p> I'm continuously trying to improve as a developer, I'm always experimenting with new technology. As I'm still happy with the design of my site I'm currently looking to change to a content-first approach that helps me to freely implement new technology on my site. My plan for the near future is to use Angular and Contentful to re-develop my site as a SPA. </p><p> In an ever-changing industry, I'm passionate about keeping current and innovative in my work. </p></section> <section> <h2>My work</h2> <ul> <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://indubai.homes">Indubai.homes Real-estate</a></li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://avilacare.com">AvilaCare Senior Living</a></li><li> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://judithblacklock.com">Judith Blacklock Flower School</a> </li><li> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.strawnomore.org">Straw No More</a> </li><li> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cristospentruromania.org">Christ for Romania Bible School</a> </li><li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://frishu.ro">Frishu Photography</a></li><li> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://danlangridge.co.uk">Dan Langridge Sound Engineer</a> </li></ul> </section> <section> <h2>I can help</h2> <p> I'm looking forward to hearing from you, whether you are a freelancer, small business or a non-profit organization and you'd like to tell me about your project or you just want to say hello, please <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreividican" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get in touch</a>. </p></section> </main> <footer> <p>©2022 All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
